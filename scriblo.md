## Frequently Asked Questions

### ❓ What counts as a valid word?
Scriblo uses the official UK Scrabble dictionary. Only three-letter words are allowed, and each word can be played only once per game.

### ❓ How do new tiles work?
When a tile spawns, you can either:
- **Tap** to accept its current position
- **Swipe** to move it to a different empty spot

### ❓ Can I swap tiles?
Yes! Swipe one tile into an adjacent tile to swap them.

### ❓ What are free moves?
Some new tiles come with 1 or 2 free moves. These let you move a tile without ending your turn — use them wisely!

### ❓ Are there achievements?
Absolutely! Completing special word combinations or game challenges will unlock achievements.
