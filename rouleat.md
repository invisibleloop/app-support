# Rouleat – Support

**Rouleat** is a simple and fun way to decide where to eat — just spin the wheel and let fate (and good taste) decide!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### ❓ How does the wheel decide where to eat?
You spin a wheel of nearby eateries. It picks one at random to help you make the choice faster and more fun.

### ❓ Does Rouleat track my location?
Rouleat uses your location **only while the app is active** to find nearby places to eat. Your location is **never stored or shared**.

### ❓ Can I customise the types of food or restaurants shown?
Not yet — but we’re planning to add filters and preferences in a future update.

### ❓ Is an internet connection required?
Yes. Rouleat uses online map data to find and suggest places near you.
