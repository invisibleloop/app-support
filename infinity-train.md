## Frequently Asked Questions

### ❓ How do I play the game?
Your train moves continuously on a 4x4 grid. Place tracks from your hand of 3 tiles to keep the train moving.
Tracks break over time, so you must constantly build new ones and repair broken sections.

### ❓ What's the difference between game modes?
- **Classic Mode (🔨)**: Focus on broken track challenges while collecting valuable tickets for bonus points
- **Extreme Mode (🔨🪨💧)**: Adds coal and water resource management — your train consumes fuel as it moves

### ❓ How do hammers work?
Hammers are limited repair tools that destroy broken tracks, clearing the path for new track placement. Use
them strategically — you earn more hammers by reaching score milestones.

### ❓ Can I change the train speed?
Yes! Adjust train speed from 2-6 seconds per track in the settings. Slower speeds give you more time to plan,
while faster speeds increase the challenge.

### ❓ What are the different track types?
- **Straight tracks**: Basic connections
- **Curved tracks**: Change train direction
- **Cross tracks**: Rare tiles that allow trains to pass through in any direction

### ❓ How does scoring work?
Earn points for each track your train successfully travels. In Classic Mode, collect tickets for bonus points.
In Extreme Mode, manage your coal and water resources carefully to maximize your run.
