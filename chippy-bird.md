beachgoers!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### ❓ How do I play?
Tap anywhere on the screen to make your seagull flap and stay airborne. Land on people eating chips to steal their snacks, but watch out for bees, obstacles, and the ground!

### ❓ What's the life bar?
You start each game with 5 life segments. Miss a chip target or hit a bee, and you'll lose one segment. When all 5 are gone, it's game over!

### ❓ What are the bubbles?
Catch bubbles during gameplay to activate a protective shield! While protected, you can safely pass through bees and obstacles without taking damage.

### ❓ How do score multipliers work?
Land on targets holding fries to increase your score multiplier. Each fry collected boosts your points — the more you grab, the higher your score!

### ❓ Can I continue after game over?
Yes! Watch a rewarded ad to get one extra life and continue your run. If you've purchased Remove Ads, you get a free continue without watching an ad.

### ❓ What does Remove Ads do?
The Remove Ads in-app purchase removes all banner and interstitial ads from the game. You'll still get free continues when you die, and rewarded ads remain optional for extra
lives.
